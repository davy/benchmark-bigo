# benchmark-bigo

Benchmark objects to help calculate Big O behavior

## Installation

In your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'benchmark-bigo'
```

Or install it manually:

```sh
$ gem install benchmark-bigo
```

## Usage

```ruby
require 'benchmark/bigo'

Benchmark.bigo do |x|
  # generator should construct a test object of the given size
  # example of an Array generator
  x.generator {|size| (0...size).to_a.shuffle }

  # or you can use the built in array generator
  # x.generate :array

  # steps is the total number of data points to collect
  # default is 10
  x.steps = 6

  # step_size is the size between steps
  # default is 100
  x.step_size = 200

  # indicates the starting size of the object to test
  # default is 100
  x.min_size = 1000

  # report takes a label and a block.
  # block is passed in the generated object and the size of that object
  x.report("#at")           {|array, size| array.at rand(size) }
  x.report("#index")        {|array, size| array.index rand(size) }
  x.report("#index-miss")   {|array, size| array.index (size + rand(size)) }

  # generate HTML chart using ChartKick
  x.chart! 'chart_array_simple.html'

  # for each report, create a comparison chart showing the report
  # and scaled series for O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n squared)
  x.compare!

  # generate an ASCII chart using gnuplot
  # works best with only one or two reports
  # otherwise the lines often overlap each other
  x.termplot!

  # generate JSON output
  x.json! 'chart_array_simple.json'

  # generate CSV output
  x.csv! 'chart_array_simple.csv'
end
```

## Generators

In order to test a block of code on an input of varying size, the benchmark tool must know how to generate this varying input. **Generators** are used to create this input to be tested. In many cases the generator creates an object, but this is not the only way generators can be used.

There are a few built-in generators to make it easy to test common objects.

### Array

The Array generator is used by calling

```
Benchmark.bigo do |x|
  x.generate :array
  ...
end
```

This generator knows how to create Arrays of varying sizes. The generated Array contains the set of numbers between 0 and (size-1), randomly shuffled. For example, a generated Array of size 5 might look like:

```
[3,2,4,1,0]
```

### String

The String generator is used by calling

```
Benchmark.bigo do |x|
  x.generate :string
  ...
end
```

This generator uses `SecureRandom.hex` to create random hexadecimal string of varying sizes. In this case the size indicates the length in *bytes* of the string to be generated. This means that the resulting string will be 2 * size. For example, a generated String of size 10 might look like:

```
"70fd739c8640b8c9212b"
```

### Size

This generator is useful when there isn't a direct object to be tested, and instead the benchmark is testing the impact of the size within the report blocks themselves. In this case, the two variables passed to the report block will both be the size value. The example shows how you might test the performance difference for iteration operations.

Example:

```
Benchmark.bigo do |x|
  x.generate :size

  x.report("#times") {|size,_|

    size.times do |i|
      # do things here
    end
  }

  x.report("for") {|size,_|

    for i in size
      # do things here
    end
  }

end
```

### Custom

There are many cases where custom generators are needed. This is the case if the code you wish to benchmark
runs against a specific type of input. A custom generator is created by specifying a block that accepts a single size parameter and returns an object of that size.

The following generator creates a Hash where each of the keys is the integer of the size and the value is a random string 10 characters long.

```
Benchmark.bigo do |x|
  x.generator do |size|
    h = {}
    (0...size).each {|i| h[i] = SecureRandom.hex(10)}
    h
  end
  ...
end

# for size 5
# => { 0 => "1fb3e5bb88815d824fff",
#      1 => "63006b6e810502f5bedd",
#      2 => "7bef4e15a2b4f9e44fa9",
#      3 => "f78319925f8c0790b409",
#      4 => "2bfc6a0a91c4949dc6ae"
#    }
```
